  <H4>Overview </H4>
  
Similar to Dan Genduso Apoll01 identity management system, my project will be a database system that downloads and stores an individual's complete history upto date. The end goal of this system is to assist individuals to find a career path that best suits their accomplishments, certifications, qualifications, merits, aspirations and most of all their values. The purpose of this platform is to create a sense of clarity for those who lack direction in life, those who are being retrenched or those who are not happy with their current career situation and outlook. This invention is a combination of Apoll01 identity management system, Seek and Jordan Petersons Self authoring program.

  <H4>Motivation</H4>

Having no real understanding for my grand future plans at a younger age, I took on the workforce. Working for a variety of companies in a variety of working environments, I allowed my interests guide me through a multitude of jobs, ultimately leading me to pursuing a career in IT. But what if there was a way to fast track this? What if there was a way to cut short the confusing and at times painful ordeal of soul searching? What if there was an equation for clarity that you could apply to your life, to fast track you on the right path?At the end of the day we are all in search for clarity, once we understand what it is we want out of life and how to go about it, then the rest is simply straight forward.

Careers Advisor 2.0 or (CA2) is an AI, designed as an upgrade and replacement from the current state of careers advisors. CA2’s sole purpose is to provide the user with a sense of clarity, it does this by providing options on different career paths that best align with the users qualifications, certifications, accomplishments, attributes, employment history, aspirations and values. CA2 has an extensive database and to the users discretion is able to access the user's files across multiple databases to get the full history of the user.

In combination with the history and records, CA2 then has a one on one interview with the user just like a careers advisor would. The only difference here is that the user is hooked up to a vr, where they will meet and talk extensively with CA2. One of the benefits of CA2 is that the AI is fully customisable, meaning the user is able to customise CA2 to their specific liking and to whom they feel most comfortable interacting with. Just like Jordan peterson’s self authoring program, the user will be asked a range of challenging, thought provoking questions in order to gain a better understanding of the user to create a complete picture. After this CA2 combines the user's background plus the answers the user as provided in order to determine the right career options that best match these. 

In CA2 also takes into account the current situation of the user, understanding that the dream career might not yet be available to the user. CA2 determines what the user requires in order to be eligible for the ideal career path and lays out a step by step plan for the user to achieve this. This is especially great for younger people entering adulthood, this AI takes a lot of the stress and ambiguity away, allowing the user the opportunity to purely focus on the task at hand on their career path.

CA2 also provides great help for the disabled, by having direct access to their medical records, CA2 will understand their strengths and weaknesses, and takes these into account when deciding what the best career options are for them. This is known as CA2 disability scheme, and is ongoing with the user for a period of 12 months, making sure the user is 100% satisfied with the predetermined career. There is no upfront payments with this scheme but after 12 months of employment the user is required to pay back on a small fraction of their yearly salary.  

There is also an added feature to CA2, where parents and users can tweak the algorithm, enabling CA2 not to identify the ideal career options for the user but to simply steer them in the right direction, not to completely rub them of the experience of sole searching. This is known as CA2 mentorship and usually requires multiple appointments of upto 12 months with CA2 to make sure the user is on the prescribed path CA2 suggested. This is a cheaper option as we want to empower users not to fully depend on CA2 for the right career but to go out and explore different options within their niches.

There are a list of suitable programmed languages used for Artificial intelligence. For CA2 I will opt to using Python simply because it is rated has developers favourite language in Artificial intelligence development and simply because it is less complex compared to Java and C++. The only real drawback with Python is not suitable for AI development for mobile devices due to its weak language for mobile computer. This is no concern of mine as CA2 is not available on mobile, but is a Virtual reality artificial intelligence. Now because CA2 will have a unique algorithm to determine the best careers for users based on all the information, we want a program that allows us to test different algorithms without implementation, thus making Python the winner, as it offers this feature.

  <H4>Skills required</H4>

CA2 will require the right software to be written and a virtually reality system that is highly interactive and multifunctional. For this I will require programmers who are highly skilled in the use of Python and who are excellent at writing and figuring out algorithms. To find the programmers who are fluent with Python is fairly straightforward. However finding someone to write the algorithm CA2 will follow will prove to be a harder task.

  <H4>Projected outcome</H4>

If this program becomes successful, the outcome of this would be life changing for many people. The impact it would have on our society would be astronomical, especially towards our economy. This program literally matches users with the right skills to the right jobs, this will greatly improve organisations and business, and our economy as a whole. With the growing need for automation in our workforce, more and more people are losing their jobs, CA2 will be of great aid to these people. Providing them with new career options as well as options of re-skill themselves for the ever changing workforce. CA2 also matches students towards the right degree, ultimately short cutting their learning curve and stress that comes with adulthood. I believe this will severely impact the rates of depression, empowering users into taking control of their own lives and careers.
